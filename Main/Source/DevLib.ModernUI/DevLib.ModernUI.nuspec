DevLib is a collection of highly reusable code and components. DevLib was initially designed through a lot of projects that I've worked on. Over time I accumulated a number of classes to handle various tasks and continue to add a number of items in my spare time. The library is written in C# and most of them support from .Net 2.0 to the latest .Net version.
